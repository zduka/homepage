    <h1>BIE-PPA</h1>
    <p>The goal of the course is to familiarize with the basics and advantages of <i>functional</i> and <i>declarative</i> programming styles and their programming languages (as opposed to the *imperative* programming style of the C/Java family languages you already know). We will start with a gentle introduction to the &lambda;-calculus, the basic abstraction for functional languages, followed by introduction to <i>Common Lisp</i>, actual programming language that is very close to the simple lambda calculus. Finally we will learn the basics of declarative programming using the <i>Prolog</i> language. </p>
    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>Translated materials for the exercises will appear here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="01-lambda-en.pdf">1 - Introduction to &lambda; calculus</a></li>
      <li><a href="02-lambda-en.pdf">2 - &lambda; calculus II</a></li>
      <li><a href="03-lambda-en.pdf">3 - &lambda; calculus III</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>I realize this page is very spartan. With time and luck, it will updated and made nicer &and; better, so be patient. Technically, this is the first proper run of the course in English. The materials will definitely not be perfect, if you spot an error, please let us know!</p>
